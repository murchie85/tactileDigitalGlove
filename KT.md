# Initial Setup & Learning Items  
  
- Decide what microcontroller package you want (i.e. `Arduino` `Raspberry Pi` or other)
- Provide an address for dispach of Arduino/Pi
	- I will include wires, LEDs, Motors, etc  
- Start getting familiar with language of choice:
	- Arduino uses `C++`  
	- Pi uses `Python`  
- Review study material or online material for basic electric circuits.  
	- Look for things like 'how to set up LED,MOTOR,Switch on a pi'  
- Look into the DeafBlind community, their challenges. Think about which section you want to help (i.e. elderly, born deafblind, deafblind in later life, or possibly just the blind - and make the glove braile compatible)  
- Consider what are your key milestones you want to deliver and what route you want to go down: I can then help you with understanding what the lower level deliverables will be. An example could include: 

## Demo Milestones and Use Case   

| Priority/Focus									  | Implication            | 
|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Glove for people who became deafblind later in life | English knowledge assumed | 
| Raspberry Pi chosen  | Python the default language | 
| Ability for glove to help interaction with careers | Front End GUI code to integrate with text messaging or web apps| 
| `Open and available` to every scientist and developer to work on   | Open source project, no IP projection or council/ investor funding possible. Focus on community building  |
| `Open Fremium model` | `Closed source`, Ip protection, Funding possible balance between community awareness, contributions and innovation|
| `commercial model` | `Closed source`, Ip protection, Funding possible. Full self-control over project |
